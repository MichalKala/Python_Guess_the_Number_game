# Python_Guess_the_Number_game

This small program generates random number 0-20 and then asks user to guess it.

This is my solution for the project described here: 
https://www.codementor.io/@ilyaas97/6-python-projects-for-beginners-yn3va03fs

"Write a programme where the computer randomly generates a number between 0 and 20. The user needs to guess what the number is. If the user guesses wrong, tell them their guess is either too high, or too low. This will get you started with the random library if you haven't already used it."

It did not take much time to come up with working version of the game, so I decided to add exception handling for when you type something else than number, to learn try/except to make it bit more interesting.
